2. **Quality over Quantity:** Less emphasis on action words, more on outcome achievement
3. **Professional Communication:** Higher use of professional tone indicators
4. **Strategic Call Length:** Willing to invest more time per call for better outcomes

#### What Low Performers Struggle With
1. **Activity-Focused:** Higher use of action words but lower conversion rates
2. **Problem-Centric:** More problem-solving language but less resolution
3. **Time Management:** Shorter calls but poor conversion efficiency
4. **Outcome Disconnect:** More activity documentation, less outcome achievement
