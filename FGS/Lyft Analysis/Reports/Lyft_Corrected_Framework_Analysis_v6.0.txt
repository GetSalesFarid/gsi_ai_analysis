═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Framework Compliance: This analysis strictly adheres to the framework rule that cross-experiment comparisons completely devalue insights. All performance analysis is conducted within experiment boundaries only, ensuring valid and actionable findings.

Within-Experiment First Call Insights

stale_approved_no_ride Experiment (2,920 calls): First calls demonstrate 8.7 percentage point advantage (32.2% vs 23.5% conversion). Top performers Richard Berry, Trevor Greenman, and Jarvis Johnson achieve 37.9%, 37.6%, and 37.5% FRR respectively through superior first call execution.

approved_no_ride Experiment (4,045 calls): Similar first call advantage pattern with 7.9 percentage point superiority (31.2% vs 23.3%). Same top performers (Richard Berry, Jarvis Johnson, Liza Alfaro) maintain excellence within this experiment context.

applied_checklist_not_started Experiment (157 calls): Unique reverse pattern showing follow-up advantage (19.5% vs 10.7% first call), led by Spencer Lane. This experiment benefits from information-gathering first calls followed by informed follow-ups.

Experiment-Specific Performance Patterns: Each experiment shows distinct optimization opportunities when analyzed in isolation. High-performing experiments (stale_approved, approved_no_ride) favor front-loaded first call strategies, while process-oriented experiments require different approaches.
