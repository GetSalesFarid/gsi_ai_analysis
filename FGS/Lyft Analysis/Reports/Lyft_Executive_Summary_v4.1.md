## Key Performance Insights

**Call Efficiency Drives Success:** Analysis reveals that high-performing reps achieve superior conversion rates through **short, focused calls averaging 1.4-1.8 minutes**, not lengthy conversations. Top performers like Richard Berry (37.9% FRR) and Spencer Lane (50.0% FRR) consistently deliver results in under 2 minutes per call.

**Language Segmentation:** English speakers dominate (98.9% of calls) with 15.1% conversion rates, while Spanish speakers (0.8% of calls) show efficiency advantages at 1.1-minute averages but lag in conversion (10.5%). Other language speakers (0.3% of calls) demonstrate the highest professional tone usage (25.0%) and match English conversion rates.

**Experiment Performance Varies Dramatically:** `approved_no_ride` and `stale_approved_no_ride` achieve 27%+ conversion rates across languages, while `checklist_started_not_completed` universally underperforms at 5-6% regardless of call duration or language, indicating process issues rather than execution problems.
