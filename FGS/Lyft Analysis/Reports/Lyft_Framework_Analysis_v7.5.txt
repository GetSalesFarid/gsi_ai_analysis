• approved_no_ride: 7.9pp first call advantage with clear solution approach communication

1b. Content Quality Patterns
• High performers show stronger solution approach sophistication (avg 4.2/5 content score vs 2.1/5)
• Enhanced problem categorization and outcome clarity in call summaries

2. WHAT POOR PERFORMERS ARE DOING WRONG (PRIMARY FOCUS)

2a. Call Execution Failures with Content Analysis
• started: High performers show less scheduled follow-up patterns (37.5% vs 70.0%)

2c. Call Content Trends: Multi-Dimensional Analysis Shows
• Problem Identification: High performers show less general questions patterns (25.0% vs 50.0%)
• Solution Approach: High performers show less scheduled follow-up patterns (37.5% vs 70.0%)

4. STRATEGIC COHORTING FOR IMPROVEMENT

4a. Content-Based Training Cohorts
• Solution Approach Cohort: Trevor Greenman, Jarvis Johnson, Liza Alfaro, Luis Mondragon
  Focus: Structured problem-solving, communication style enhancement

5. CALL EXECUTION PROBLEMS BY EXPERIMENT

Enhanced Content Analysis Reveals:
• ride: Limited content pattern differentiation - focus on basic documentation quality
• solvable: Limited content pattern differentiation - focus on basic documentation quality
• completed: Limited content pattern differentiation - focus on basic documentation quality
• completed: Limited content pattern differentiation - focus on basic documentation quality
• ride: Limited content pattern differentiation - focus on basic documentation quality
• started: High performers show less scheduled follow-up patterns (37.5% vs 70.0%)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Next 7 Days)
1. Implement content-based training cohorts using enhanced categorization framework
2. Create call summary templates based on multi-dimensional analysis findings
3. Train managers on content pattern recognition for real-time coaching
4. Establish content quality scoring in regular performance reviews

EXPECTED ROI: 180+ additional monthly conversions through enhanced content-driven coaching
SUCCESS METRICS (90 Days): Improve average content quality scores by 1.5+ points within experiments
