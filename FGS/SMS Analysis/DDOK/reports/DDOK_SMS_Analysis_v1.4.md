**Scoring Framework:**
- Overall Score = (QA Score × 40%) + (Conversion Score × 60%)
- QA Scoring based on Conversation Effectiveness + Brand Alignment
- Conversion Scoring uses multiplier system:
  • 0-10% conversion → 0/100
  • 11-20% conversion → rate × 1.75
  • 21-30% conversion → rate × 2.0
  • 31-33% conversion → rate × 2.1
  • 34%+ conversion → rate × 2.2 (uncapped - can exceed 100)
- Minimum 100 opportunities required for statistical significance
- AI Agent performance tracked separately using ai_agent_tag
