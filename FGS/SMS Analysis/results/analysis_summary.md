# ðŸ“± DOORDASH SMS CAMPAIGNS - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL CALLOUTS

### 1. **Tier Coverage Gaps**
- **AnD Campaigns**: Tiers 0,1 get straightforward campaigns, but tiers 2,3,4 are split into complex A/B tests
- **Risk**: Tier 2,3 leads in hash groups 0-4 might get different treatment quality than hash 5-9 (AI vs traditional)
- **Recommendation**: Monitor conversion rates by hash group to ensure no systematic bias

### 2. **AI Agent Test Concentration Risk**
- **All Tier 4** leads automatically go to AI agent campaigns
- **Tiers 2,3** split 50/50 between AI and traditional
- **Risk**: If AI performs poorly, you're potentially harming your highest-value leads (tier 4)
- **Recommendation**: Consider holdout groups for tier 4 or gradual rollout

### 3. **Geographic Campaign Complexity**
- **Australia** has completely parallel campaign structure but with different timing logic
- **Australia VPFD**: Sends day BEFORE VPFD (timezone adjusted) vs US same-day
- **Risk**: Operational complexity and potential configuration errors
- **Recommendation**: Standardize timing logic where possible

### 4. **Sequential Campaign Dependencies**
- **EV Campaigns**: 4-step sequence (Initial â†’ DDOK 2 â†’ DDOK 3 â†’ 31D Applied)
- **AnD Campaigns**: 2-step sequence (Initial â†’ Final) with 4-day wait
- **Risk**: Broken sequences if leads change status mid-flow
- **Recommendation**: Add sequence integrity checks

### 5. **Potential Over-Communication**
- **LTV Campaigns**: Can theoretically receive VPFD + 21D DDOK + High Deliveries
- **Up-funnel**: Can receive IDV reminder + 2D tag + follow-up + VPFD lapsed
- **Risk**: Excessive SMS volume leading to opt-outs
- **Recommendation**: Implement daily/weekly SMS frequency caps

### 6. **Disabled Campaign Technical Debt**
- Multiple campaigns have `1=2` (permanently disabled) but still in code
- **Examples**: vpfd_b, australia_vpfd_a, most launch/abandon campaigns
- **Risk**: Code bloat and confusion
- **Recommendation**: Remove disabled campaigns or document why they're preserved

### 7. **Inconsistent Eligibility Filter Usage**
- **Mixed Filters**: Some use `default_sms_eligibility_filters`, others `default_unmanned_sms_eligibility_filters`
- **Stale Campaigns**: Use `stale_sms_eligibility_filters`
- **Up-funnel**: Use `up_funnel_no_bgc_eligibility_filters`
- **Risk**: Inconsistent audience definitions
- **Recommendation**: Audit and standardize filter definitions

### 8. **Timezone Complexity**
- **LTV Campaigns**: Complex timezone-based sending (after 5pm local time)
- **Expired GTG**: Different time thresholds by timezone (2:30pm-4:30pm)
- **Risk**: Operational errors and inconsistent user experience
- **Recommendation**: Simplify to fewer timezone rules

### 9. **Experiment Tag Dependency Risk**
- **Critical Dependencies**: Many campaigns require specific experiment_tag values
- **Risk**: Campaign failure if experiment tags aren't properly maintained
- **Examples**: EV campaigns require tags >= '2025-04-04', Australia up-funnel requires specific 2024/2025 tags
- **Recommendation**: Implement experiment tag validation and rollover procedures

### 10. **Lead Cohort Transition Gaps**
- **Waitlist â†’ AnD**: Clear transition path
- **AnD â†’ LTV**: Gap - what happens between delivery and 21+ days?
- **Up-funnel â†’ AnD**: Potential timing conflicts
- **Risk**: Leads falling through cracks during status transitions
- **Recommendation**: Map complete lead lifecycle and identify gaps

## ðŸ’¡ OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. **Hash-Based A/B Testing**
- Very sophisticated 50/50 split system
- **Opportunity**: Leverage this for rapid experimentation beyond AI vs traditional

### 2. **Delivery Count Segmentation**
- Smart segmentation at 47/48 deliveries for LTV campaigns
- **Opportunity**: Apply similar logic to other behavioral segments

### 3. **Geographic Scaling**
- Australia parallel structure proves international scalability
- **Opportunity**: Template for expanding to other countries

### 4. **Contact Status Precision**
- Sophisticated tracking of attempted vs unattempted, contacted vs uncontacted
- **Opportunity**: Use this granularity for more personalized messaging

## MAJOR OVERLAP PATTERNS

### 1. TIER-BASED SEGMENTATION:
   - Tiers 0,1: Primary targets for most AnD campaigns
   - Tiers 2,3: Split between control (hash 0-4) and AI test (hash 5-9)
   - Tier 4: All go to AI test groups
   - LTV campaigns: Tiers 0,1,2,3,4 with delivery count segmentation

### 2. CONTACT STATUS OVERLAPS:
   - Attempted vs Unattempted: Mutually exclusive based on outbound call history
   - Contacted vs Uncontacted: Mutually exclusive based on first_contact_date
   - All require NO inbound SMS or first contact for initial campaigns

### 3. GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION:
   - US vs Australia: Completely separate campaign sets
   - Australia has parallel campaign structure with different opportunity IDs

### 4. TIMING-BASED OVERLAPS:
   - Standard vs Missed: Alternative sending for weekends/holidays
   - Initial vs Final: Sequential campaigns with waiting periods
   - VPFD vs VPFD Lapsed: Different timing windows (same day vs 2-7 days later)

### 5. A/B TEST OVERLAPS:
   - Hash-based splitting (0-4 vs 5-9) for many campaigns
   - AI Agent vs Traditional: Systematic testing across tier 2,3,4
   - Language-based: English vs Spanish VPFD campaigns

### 6. EXPERIMENT-BASED OVERLAPS:
   - Up-funnel campaigns: Specific experiment tag requirements
   - EV campaigns: Handraiser vs Standard experiments
   - Stale campaigns: Specific stale experiment tags

### 7. DELIVERY-BASED SEGMENTATION:
   - Pre-delivery: All funnel conversion campaigns
   - Post-delivery: LTV campaigns only
   - Delivery count: <48 vs >=48 for LTV segmentation

## KEY EXCLUSION RULES:
- No campaign sends to leads with first_contact_date (except specific exceptions)
- No duplicate SMS sends (checked via campaign-specific received fields)
- No SMS to leads with recent automated SMS (last_automated_sms_timestamp checks)
- Geographic exclusions (Australia vs US)
- Experiment tag requirements create natural segmentation
- Lead cohort requirements ('Approved No Delivery', 'AUS - Approved No Delivery', etc.)
