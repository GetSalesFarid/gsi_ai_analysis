KEY INSIGHTS & SYSTEM COMPARISON
================================

Classification System Effectiveness (After Bug Fix):
• 20-Category system achieves +79.5 percentage point classification difference
• 20-Category system utilizes 105.0% of available categories vs 6.8% for fixed JSON
• Fixed JSON system now uses 4/59 buckets (much better than 4/59)

Performance Consistency:
• Both systems show same conversion rates (confirming data reliability)
• Fixed JSON system now shows realistic classification patterns
• AnD AI consistently outperforms traditional AnD in both systems

System Design Insights:
• 20-Category system: Simpler, more pragmatic approach with 20 categories
• Fixed JSON system: Now working properly with 59 buckets and realistic utilization
• Both systems now show meaningful bucket/category distribution

Impact of Bug Fix:
• Reveals true performance of original JSON system
• Shows realistic bucket utilization patterns
• Enables proper system comparison for decision making

Updated Recommendations:
1. Compare actual classification effectiveness of both systems
2. Evaluate which system provides better actionable insights
3. Consider operational complexity vs analytical depth trade-offs
4. Focus on AI-powered messaging approaches (AnD AI) as they consistently outperform
5. Use bug-free data for all future system evaluations
