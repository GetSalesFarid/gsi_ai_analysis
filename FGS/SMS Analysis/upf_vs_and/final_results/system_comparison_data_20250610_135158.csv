AnD AI,"It sounds like you might need to adjust your delivery zone settings in the app to include Palmdale or Lancaster. You can do this by going to the app settings and selecting your preferred delivery area.

As for scheduling, reserving a slot guarantees you a spot to dash during busy times, like lunch or dinner rush, even if the area is crowded with other Dashers. This way, you won't miss out on potential earnings. Many Dashers find that scheduling ahead helps them plan their day better and ensures they can dash when it's most profitable.

Have you tried checking the schedule during peak lunch or dinner times to see if you can reserve a spot? It might be a great way to start earning right away!",Personal Circumstances,TSI-WN-001,
AnD AI,"Absolutely, you can definitely DoorDash in Palmdale or Lancaster! While these areas might be smaller, they still have activity, especially on weekends. Some Dashers in smaller markets travel to the nearest busier zones to maximize their orders.

AnD AI,"It sounds like there might be a small issue with the app settings. Let's try a few quick steps to fix it:

1. **Clear the app cache**: 
   - **iPhone**: Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Select the DoorDash Driver App > Tap Delete App, then reinstall it.
   - **Android**: Go to Settings > Apps > Select the DoorDash Driver App > Tap Storage > Clear Cache and Clear Data, then restart your phone.

2. **Close unused apps**: Make sure to hard close any apps you're not using to free up resources.

3. **Switch to cellular data**: Disconnect from WiFi, hard close the Dasher app, and reopen it using your cellular data.

Once you've tried these steps, check if you can see Palmdale or Lancaster as options. Let me know how it goes! When do you think you'll be able to try this out?",Scheduling Issues,TSI-WN-001,
AnD AI,"It sounds like the areas you're checking might not be busy at the moment, which is why they're showing up as gray. This usually means there aren't enough orders to support more Dashers right now. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Stay in Red or Pink Zones**: These are areas with high demand. If you see any nearby, try heading there to start receiving orders.

2. **Check During Peak Hours**: Try opening the app during lunch (11 AM - 2 PM) or dinner (5 PM - 9 PM) times. These are typically busier, and you might see the Dash Now button become available.

3. **Explore Nearby Red Zones**: If you see any red zones on the map, consider driving there to start dashing.

#2) Check the map often. 11:30am and 5:30pm are two of the best times to look.

*Note* You can only receive orders if you are PHYSICALLY inside a Red Zone

1.)Schedule yourself to get priority (there is no obligation to complete a shift nor is it mandatory to schedule to work). The schedule updated every day @ midnight.
2.)Peak times are between 11-2 and 5-9 and typically the best times to ""dash now""
3.)If you dash now, be sure to start your dash in a red/pink zone
4.)You can click a busy submarket in your area to ""dash along the way""
5.)Schedules are released 5 days in advance at midnight. This will help secure a slot for the lunch & dinner rushes.
6.)Dash by top restaurants to get more orders. Search ""doordash restaurants"" on google maps to see nearby partner restaurants

- Rush hours are 11am-2pm & 5pm-9pm.
- To start Dashing, you need to physically be in a Red zone.
- Please stay on the move and DO NOT wait in one area as the app will think you are inactive.
- Avoid hotspots with a fire icon, but I recommend zones marked as 'Busy' with 1-3 bars.
- No need to schedule, but if timeslots are available, I recommend them!

Try this next time you go out:
1.Make sure your phone's wifi is completely turned off.  Using mobile data works much better and if you have the option for wifi on, it may try to connect to a restaurant's wifi in the background causing connection errors.  
2.If you see a fire icon in your zone, make sure to click on it and press ""Navigate to hot spot"".  Hot spots are busy restaurants or stores where you should get an order much quicker! 

Pro-tip #1: Check the schedule and map often. 11:30am and 5:30pm are two of the best times to look.
 
Pro-tip #2: Dash by top restaurants to get more orders. Download the food delivery app to see where most orders or promos are.

Pro-tip #3: Drive to the red areas to Dash Now! If you miss the schedule, this is where you'll find the most deliveries.
 
Pro-tip #4: Check the app just after midnight (12:01am) to check for the newest schedule release

Avoid hot spots since they are over saturated with dashers, but make sure that when you are dashing, you stay within the Red Zones! I would also highly recommend hanging around restaurants that you know are busy, and popular fast food places like McDonalds and Wendys. If you are sitting in one spot for more than 5 minutes, try driving around the block. Once you get your first order, the rest come quickly!

AnD,"Pro-tip #1: Scheduling is optional. Drive to the red areas and tap on Dash Now! This is where you'll start receiving deliveries.
Pro-tip #2: Check the map often. 11:30am and 5:30pm are two of the best times to look.
Pro-tip #3: Dash by top restaurants and fast food places to get more orders. (McDonalds, Wendy's) Drive around to receive orders, avoid parking for more than a few minutes and waiting!
Pro-tip #4: If you would like to schedule a dash, check the app just after midnight (12:01am) to check for the newest schedule release
Pro-tip #5: Avoid sitting at fire signs! They are often over saturated with Dashers. But stay in the red zones!
