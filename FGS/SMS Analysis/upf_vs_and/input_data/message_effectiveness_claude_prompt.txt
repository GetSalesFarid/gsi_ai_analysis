You are analyzing sales support chat messages sent to prospective Dashers in three groups: "UpF" (Upfunnel), "AnD" (Approved No Delivery), and "AnD AI" (AI-powered responses). Each unique dasher is identified by the field "opportunity_uuid".

You have the input file:
1. "BGC_vs_AND_messages.csv" — contains chat messages, timestamps, direction, and conversion indicators such as "full_conversion".

Your goal is to produce an executive summary report using a proven 20-category classification system.

Your tasks:
-----------------------------
1. Message Classification
- Use the proven 20-category system for message classification (Equipment Concerns, Market Concerns, Personal Circumstances, Needs Guidance, Payment Questions, Scheduling Issues, Background Check, etc.)
- This system has achieved 88.6% classification success rate with meaningful category distribution
- Classify each message based on content patterns and themes

2. Tag Group Performance Analysis
- For each tag group (UpF, AnD, AnD AI), calculate:
  • Total number of leads/conversations
  • Overall classification success rate (% of messages classified vs unclassified)
  • Overall conversion rate (full_conversion = TRUE)
  • BGC conversion rate if available

3. Category Performance by Tag Group
- For each of the 20 categories, report by tag group:
  • Number and % of conversations in this category
  • Conversion rate for this category
  • Which tag group performs best in this category

4. Executive Insights
- Identify top-performing categories (>30% conversion)
- Identify underperforming categories (<20% conversion)
- Compare tag group effectiveness across categories
- Provide actionable recommendations

Output Format:
-----------------------------
Produce an EXECUTIVE SUMMARY in .txt format with the following structure:
