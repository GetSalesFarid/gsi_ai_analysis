## Call Duration Insights (Critical Corrections)

### Duration vs Conversion Patterns

#### Optimal Call Duration by Language and Experiment
| Experiment | English Optimal | Spanish Optimal | Other Optimal | Key Pattern |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **approved_no_ride** | 1.7-1.8 min | 0.8-1.5 min | 0.9-2.8 min | Efficiency scales with complexity |
| **stale_approved_no_ride** | 1.3-1.9 min | 1.0-1.2 min | 0.4-1.1 min | Quick turnaround critical |
| **eligibility_started** | 1.0-2.8 min | 2.0 min | 0.4-2.9 min | Personalization pays off |
| **rejected_solvable** | 0.6-1.9 min | N/A | 0.6 min | Speed essential for re-engagement |

### Universal Duration Principles
1. **Sweet Spot:** 1.0-2.0 minutes for most successful calls
2. **Language Adaptation:** Spanish speakers prefer shorter calls (0.8-1.5 min)
