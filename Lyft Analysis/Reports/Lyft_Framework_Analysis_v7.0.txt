EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Framework Compliance: This analysis strictly adheres to the framework requirement that cross-experiment comparisons completely devalue insights. All performance analysis is conducted within experiment boundaries only, ensuring valid and actionable findings.

1. WHAT TOP PERFORMERS ARE DOING RIGHT

1a. First Call Execution Excellence
   • lyft_w_plus_funnel_conversion_stale_approved_no_ride: 36.2% first call conversion through immediate value demonstration
   • lyft_w_plus_funnel_conversion_approved_no_ride: 33.9% first call conversion through immediate value demonstration

1b. Call Quality and Communication Style
   • lyft_w_plus_funnel_conversion_stale_approved_no_ride: First Call Excellence: 36.2% conversion rate through strong initial value proposition
   • lyft_w_plus_funnel_conversion_approved_no_ride: First Call Excellence: 33.9% conversion rate through strong initial value proposition

1c. Conversation Content and Questioning Techniques
