CLASSIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS (UPDATED):
-------------------------------------
1. Match message content to identification phrases in each bucket

3. Consider context - one message may fit multiple buckets, choose most specific
4. NEW: Prioritize high-performance buckets (HCP, AI prefixes) when applicable
5. NEW: Use expanded technical categories (TSI prefix) for better issue resolution
6. If no clear match, classify as "OTHER" or "UNCLASSIFIED"
7. Inbound vs Outbound messages may require different classification approaches

EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION (UPDATED):
-------------------------------
Based on analysis findings, expect:
- 15-20% in various NO ORDERS/MARKET buckets (expanded phrases should capture more)
- 12-18% in PERSONAL CONSTRAINTS buckets (expanded identification)
- 10-15% in TECHNICAL/APP issues (now split into specific categories)
- 8-12% in BACKGROUND CHECK buckets
- 8-12% in EQUIPMENT/DELIVERY buckets (now includes new UNC buckets)
- 6-10% in NEW UNCLASSIFIED CAPTURE buckets (UNC prefix)
- 3-8% in HIGH-PERFORMANCE buckets (HCP prefix)
- 2-5% in AnD AI specific buckets (AI prefix)
- <10% remaining unclassified (down from 28.7%)
