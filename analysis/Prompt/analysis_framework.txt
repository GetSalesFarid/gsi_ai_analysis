# DDOK SMS ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
# Executive Summary: Sales Representative Performance Analysis

## OVERVIEW
This framework defines the requirements for creating an executive summary that grades sales representatives based on SMS message quality and conversion performance.

## DATA SOURCES
### Primary Files:
- INPUT_SMS_FILE: data/ddok_sms_fgs_l3m.csv
- INPUT_CONVERSIONS_FILE: data/ddok_sms_fgs_l3m_conversions.csv
- QA_PROMPT_FILE: resources/sms_ddok_qa_prompt

### Data Join Strategy:
- Primary key: opportunity_uuid
- Challenge: SMS file has multiple rows per opportunity (one per task), conversions file has one row per opportunity
- Solution: Deduplicate appropriately to avoid inflated metrics --- double check this, failed on v1.0

## SALES REP IDENTIFICATION LOGIC
### AI Agent Handling:
- IF ai_agent_tag = TRUE in conversions file: 
  - SET owner_name = "AI Agent"
- ELSE:
  - USE owner_name from conversions file

### Minimum Threshold:
- MINIMUM_OPPORTUNITIES_PER_REP: 100
- Only analyze reps with >= minimum opportunities for statistical significance

## SCORING METHODOLOGY

### Overall Score Calculation (100 points total):
- QA Score Weight: 40%
- Conversion Rate Weight: 60%
- Formula: (QA_Score * 0.4) + (Conversion_Rate_Normalized * 0.6)

### QA Scoring (40% of total):
- Use sms_ddok_qa_prompt framework
- Evaluate OUTBOUND messages only
- Score each message 0-100 using prompt criteria:
  - Conversation Effectiveness (0-50 points)
  - Brand Alignment (0-50 points)
- Calculate average QA score per rep across all their messages

### Conversion Rate Scoring (60% of total):
- Calculate: (successful_conversions / total_opportunities) * 100
- Normalize to 0-100 scale for scoring
- NORMALIZATION_METHOD: [EDIT: Choose method - linear, percentile-based, etc.]
- CONVERSION_CAP: 100% -- if you have a anyone over 100 the joins have failed and ask to re-run the analysis, 

## QA EVALUATION PARAMETERS
### Company-Specific Variables (for sms_ddok_qa_prompt):
- COMPANY_NAME: [EDIT: Insert company name, e.g., "DoorDash"]
- WORKER_TYPE: [EDIT: Insert worker type, e.g., "Dasher"]
- WORK_ACTIVITY: [EDIT: Insert activity, e.g., "Dashing"]
- EXAMPLE_HOURLY_RATE: [EDIT: Insert rate, e.g., "25"]

### Sensitive Topics & Guidelines:
- SENSITIVE_TOPICS_CONTENT: [EDIT: Add company-specific banned topics/language]
- TONE_GUIDELINES: [EDIT: Add specific tone requirements]
- BRAND_VOICE: [EDIT: Add brand voice characteristics]

### Message Evaluation Criteria:
- MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH: 300 characters
- EMOJI_LIMIT: [EDIT: Set emoji usage limits]
- REQUIRED_CTA: [EDIT: Specify if CTA is mandatory]
- PROFESSIONAL_LANGUAGE: [EDIT: Define professional language standards]

## ANALYSIS DEPTH REQUIREMENTS

### Statistical Analysis:
- CONFIDENCE_LEVEL: 90%
- SAMPLE_SIZE_VALIDATION: Enable
- OUTLIER_HANDLING: remove outliers in main analysis, call them out at the end of the report 

### Performance Metrics:
- Calculate per rep:
  - Total opportunities handled
  - Total messages sent
  - Average messages per opportunity
  - Message response rate (if inbound data available)
  - Conversion funnel metrics
  - QA score distribution (min, max, std dev)

### Comparative Analysis:
- Rank reps by overall score
- Calculate percentile rankings
- Identify top/bottom performers
- Generate peer comparison insights

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### Executive Summary Structure:
1. Overall Performance Overview
2. Top Performers (Top 20% or Top 5, whichever is larger)
3. Individual Rep Analysis
4. Performance Distribution Analysis
5. Key Insights & Recommendations

### Individual Rep Analysis (for each rep):
- Overall Grade: X/100
- Rank: #X of Y total reps
- QA Score: X/100 (40% weight)
- Conversion Rate: X% (60% weight)
- Key Metrics:
  - Total opportunities: X
  - Total messages: X
  - Avg messages/opportunity: X
  - Message quality consistency (std dev)

### Feedback Format (per rep):
- 2 Positive Bullet Points:
  - Focus on strengths in QA or conversion performance
  - Highlight best practices or standout metrics
- 2 Areas for Improvement:
  - Specific, actionable feedback
  - Based on QA analysis and conversion gaps

### Performance Insights:
- CORRELATION_ANALYSIS: Enable 
- MESSAGE_PATTERNS: Enable
- TIMING_ANALYSIS: Enable
- LENGTH_ANALYSIS: Enable

## QUALITY CONTROLS

### Data Validation:
- Validate opportunity_uuid uniqueness in conversions file
- Check for missing owner names
- Validate message content (non-null, reasonable length)
- Flag incomplete records for review

### Analysis Validation:
- Cross-check conversion calculations
- Validate QA scoring consistency
- Ensure statistical significance thresholds
- Flag edge cases (e.g., 100%+ conversion rates)

### Output Validation:
- Verify score calculations
- Check ranking logic
- Validate feedback generation
- Ensure all reps included appropriately

## CUSTOMIZATION SECTIONS

### Business Context:
- ANALYSIS_PURPOSE: Grade SMS scores and find out what drives success in the DDOK message
- STAKEHOLDER_AUDIENCE: Non technical sales managers and VP of the account 
- ACTION_ORIENTATION: Share best practices across the team, which includes adding human best practices to the AI chatbot

### Performance Standards:
- EXCELLENT_QA_THRESHOLD: 85+
- GOOD_QA_THRESHOLD: 70+
- OK_QA_THRESHOLD: 50+
- ATTENTION_NEEDED_QA_THRESHOLD: < 50
- EXCELLENT_CONVERSION_THRESHOLD: 50%+ 
- GOOD_CONVERSION_THRESHOLD: 40%+ 
- OK_CONVERSION_THRESHOLD: 33%+
- POOR_CONVERSION_THRESHOLD: 33%+
- ATTENTION_NEEDED_CONVERSION_THRESHOLD: < 33%
- ** when scoreing the conversions the points out of 100 should be: **
      0-10% conversion — 0/100
      11-20% comversion — (X% * 1.75) ie 13% = 26pts/100 
      21-30% comversion — (X% * 2)
      31-33% comversion — (X% * 2.1)
      34%+ comversion — (X% * 2.2)
      this score can go over 100, do not cap at 100
