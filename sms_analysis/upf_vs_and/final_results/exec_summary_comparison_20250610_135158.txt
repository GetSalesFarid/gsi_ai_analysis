KEY INSIGHTS & SYSTEM COMPARISON
================================

Classification System Effectiveness:
• 20-Category system achieves -20.3 percentage point better classification
• 20-Category system utilizes 105.0% of available categories vs 6.8% for original JSON
• Original JSON system is under-utilized with only 4/59 buckets active

Performance Consistency:
• Both systems show same conversion rates (confirming data reliability)
• Classification differences suggest 20-category system captures more message types
• AnD AI consistently outperforms traditional AnD in both systems

System Design Insights:
• 20-Category system: Simpler, more pragmatic approach with 20 categories
• Original JSON system: Complex with 59 buckets but poor utilization
• 20-Category system shows better balance between granularity and usability

Recommendations:
1. ADOPT 20-Category system for operational use due to better classification rate and utilization
2. Original JSON system needs bucket consolidation - too many unused buckets
3. Focus on AI-powered messaging approaches (AnD AI) as they consistently outperform
4. Consider hybrid approach: use 20-category for classification, original JSON for detailed response guidance
5. Investigate why original JSON system under-classifies messages - identification phrases may be too specific
